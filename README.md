# COVID

COVID is an iOS app written with SwiftUI. It tracks the current worldwide status of the COVID-19 pandemic. The idea and UI were mostly taken from a Kavsoft video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEjiDemnkoI). It also pointed me to the API and I added some additional info and a couple more countries.
